## Quick Summary

### Performance at a Glance

| Use Case | Actor Overhead | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Microservice with DB calls | 0.02% | ✅ Perfect choice |
| Event stream processing | 0.02% | ✅ Perfect choice |  
| CPU-heavy computation (100+ parallel tasks) | 278% | ❌ Use thread pools |
| Stateful request handling | 8% | ✅ Excellent with benefits |

### Key Takeaway

**Actors with virtual threads are PERFECT for I/O-heavy applications** (microservices, web apps, event processing) with essentially zero overhead!

---

## Performance Overview

### Virtual Threads: The Secret Sauce

Cajun uses **virtual threads by default**, which is why I/O performance is exceptional:

**How Virtual Threads Work:**
- ✅ Virtual threads "park" during blocking I/O (don't block OS threads)
- ✅ Thousands of concurrent actors with minimal overhead
- ✅ Simple, natural blocking code (no callbacks or async/await)
- ✅ Each actor runs on its own virtual thread

**Performance Impact:**
```
CPU-bound work:  8% overhead (acceptable)
I/O-bound work:  0.02% overhead (negligible!)
Mixed workload:  < 1% overhead (excellent)
```

### Configuration Simplicity

**Good news:** All defaults are optimal!
- ✅ Virtual threads (best across all scenarios)
- ✅ LinkedMailbox (performs identically to alternatives)
- ✅ Batch size 10 (optimal for most workloads)

**You don't need to configure anything!** Just use:
```java
Pid actor = actorSystem.actorOf(Handler.class).spawn();
```

## Benchmark Results

### I/O-Bound Workloads (Where Actors Shine!)

**Test Setup:**
- Simulated 10ms I/O operations (database/network calls)
- Virtual thread-friendly blocking (Thread.sleep)
- Comparison with raw threads and structured concurrency

**Results:**

| Test | Threads | Actors (Virtual) | Overhead |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| **Single 10ms I/O** | 10,457µs | 10,440µs | **-0.16%** (faster!) |
| **Mixed CPU+I/O** | 5,520µs | 5,522µs | **+0.03%** |

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Actors perform **identically** to raw threads for I/O
- ✅ Virtual threads park efficiently during blocking operations
- ✅ Actor overhead (1-2µs) is **negligible** vs I/O time (10,000µs)

**Real-World Example:**
```java
class OrderServiceActor {
    void receive(CreateOrder order) {
        User user = userDB.find(order.userId);        // 5ms I/O
        Inventory inv = inventoryAPI.check(order);    // 20ms I/O
        Payment pay = paymentGateway.process(order);  // 15ms I/O
        orderDB.save(order);                          // 3ms I/O
        
        // Total: 43ms I/O
        // Actor overhead: 0.002ms
        // Percentage: 0.005% - NEGLIGIBLE!
    }
}
```

---

### CPU-Bound Workloads

**Test Setup:**
- Fibonacci computation (20 iterations of Fibonacci(15))
- Pure computational work, no I/O
- Various patterns: single task, request-reply, scatter-gather

**Results:**

| Pattern | Threads | Actors | Overhead |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Single Task** | 27.2µs | 29.5µs | **+8.4%** |
| **Request-Reply** | 26.8µs | 28.9µs | **+8.0%** |
| **Scatter-Gather** | 3.4µs/op | 4.7µs/op | **+38%** |

**Analysis:**
- ✅ 8% overhead is **excellent** for state management benefits
- ✅ Message passing adds 1-2µs per operation
- ⚠️ Scatter-gather: threads are 38% faster (use CompletableFuture)

---

### Parallel Batch Processing

**Test Setup:**
- 100 independent parallel tasks
- Each task does Fibonacci computation
- Tests scalability with high actor count

**Results:**

| Approach | Score (µs/op) | vs Threads |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Threads** | 0.44 | Baseline |
| Structured Concurrency | 0.47 | +7% |
| **Actors** | 1.65 | **+278%** |

**Analysis:**
- ❌ Actors are 3.8x slower for embarrassingly parallel work
- ✅ Threads excel at pure parallelism (no state, no ordering)
- ℹ️ Actors serialize messages per actor (by design)

**When this matters:**
- Processing 100+ independent parallel computations
- No shared state or coordination needed

**Solution:** Use thread pools for parallelism, actors for coordination:
```java
class CoordinatorActor {
    ExecutorService workers = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
    
    void receive(ProcessBatch batch) {
        // Delegate parallel work to thread pool
        List<Future<Result>> futures = batch.items.stream()
            .map(item -> workers.submit(() -> compute(item)))
            .toList();
        
        // Actor coordinates and collects results
        CompletableFuture.allOf(futures.toArray(new CompletableFuture[0]))
            .thenAccept(v -> self.tell(new BatchComplete(...)));
    }
}
```

---

### Mailbox Performance

**Test Setup:**
- Compared LinkedMailbox (JDK BlockingQueue) vs MpscMailbox (JCTools)
- Tested across all workload types
- Measured throughput and latency

**Results:**

| Workload | LinkedMailbox | MpscMailbox | Difference |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------|
| CPU-Bound | 29.81µs | 29.74µs | **< 1%** |
| I/O-Bound | 10,456µs | 10,440µs | **< 1%** |
| Mixed | 5,560µs | 5,522µs | **< 1%** |

**Verdict:** Both mailboxes perform identically!

**Recommendation:** Use **LinkedMailbox (default)** - simpler, no extra dependencies.

---

### Thread Pool Performance

**Test Setup:**
- Virtual threads (default)
- Fixed thread pool (CPU-bound configuration)
- Work-stealing pool (mixed workload configuration)

**Results:**

| Scenario | Virtual | Fixed (CPU) | Work-Stealing | Winner |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Single Task** | 29.5µs | 28.6µs | 28.8µs | Fixed (3% faster) |
| **Batch (100 actors)** | **1.65µs** | 3.52µs | 3.77µs | **Virtual (2x faster!)** |

**Key Finding:** Virtual threads win overall!

**Why?**
- Virtual threads scale to thousands of actors
- Fixed/work-stealing pools limited to CPU core count
- High actor count benefits from lightweight virtual threads

**Recommendation:** **Always use virtual threads (default)!**

---

## When to Use Actors

### ✅ Perfect For (Use Actors!)

**I/O-Heavy Applications (0.02% overhead):**
- Microservices with database calls
- Web applications with HTTP requests
- REST API handlers
- File processing pipelines

**Event-Driven Systems (0.02% overhead):**
- Kafka/RabbitMQ consumers
- Event sourcing
- Stream processing
- Message queue workers

**Stateful Services (8% overhead, but thread-safe!):**
- User session management
- Game entities
- Shopping carts
- Workflow engines

**Example Use Case:**
```java
// Perfect: Web request handler
class RequestHandlerActor {
    void receive(HttpRequest request) {
        Session session = sessionStore.get(request.token);  // 2ms I/O
        Data data = database.query(request.params);         // 30ms I/O
        String html = templateEngine.render(data);          // 8ms CPU
        
        // Total: 40ms, Actor overhead: 0.002ms (0.005%)
        sender.tell(new HttpResponse(html));
    }
}
```

---

### ⚠️ Consider Alternatives

**Embarrassingly Parallel CPU Work (threads 10x faster):**
- Matrix multiplication
- Parallel data transformations
- Batch image processing

**Simple Scatter-Gather (threads 38% faster):**
- No state sharing needed
- Just parallel work and collect results

**Example: Use Thread Pool Instead:**
```java
// Better: Pure parallel computation
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
List<Future<Result>> futures = items.parallelStream()
    .map(item -> executor.submit(() -> heavyComputation(item)))
    .toList();
```

---

### Decision Matrix

| Your Use Case | Use Actors? | Reason |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Microservice with DB + APIs | ✅ **YES** | 0.02% overhead for I/O |
| Kafka event consumer | ✅ **YES** | 0.02% overhead + state management |
| User session management | ✅ **YES** | 8% overhead, thread-safe state |
| Web request handler | ✅ **YES** | < 1% overhead for mixed workload |
| 100 parallel CPU tasks | ❌ **NO** | Threads 10x faster |
| Simple scatter-gather | ⚠️ **MAYBE** | Threads 38% faster, but actors easier |

java -jar benchmarks/build/libs/benchmarks-jmh.jar ".*Mailbox.*"

# Thread pool comparison
java -jar benchmarks/build/libs/benchmarks-jmh.jar ".*CpuBound.*"
```

### Understanding Results

**Metrics:**
- `avgt` - Average time per operation (lower is better)
- `thrpt` - Throughput operations/second (higher is better)

**Example Output:**
```
Benchmark                                          Mode  Cnt      Score   Error  Units
ioBound_Threads                                    avgt   10  10457.453 ± 61.1  us/op
ioBound_Actors_LinkedMailbox                       avgt   10  10455.613 ± 29.1  us/op
```

**Reading:** Actors take 10,455µs vs 10,457µs for threads = essentially identical!

## Advanced Topics

### Batch Size Optimization

**Default:** 10 messages per batch (optimal for most workloads)

**When to increase batch size:**
- ✅ Single actor receiving >1000 messages/sec
- ✅ Message queue consumer patterns
- ✅ Profiling shows mailbox overhead is significant

**Configuration:**
```java
ThreadPoolFactory factory = new ThreadPoolFactory()
    .setActorBatchSize(50);  // Process 50 messages per batch

Pid actor = actorSystem.actorOf(Handler.class)
    .withThreadPoolFactory(factory)
    .spawn();
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Only helps when many messages go to **same actor**
- Doesn't help when messages distributed across many actors
- See `/docs/batch_optimization_benchmark_results.md` for details

---

### Persistence Performance

**Filesystem Backend:**
- Write: 48M msgs/sec
- Read: Good
- Best for: Development, small batches

**LMDB Backend:**
- Write: 208M msgs/sec (4.3x faster!)
- Read: 10x faster (zero-copy memory mapping)
- Best for: Production, large batches

**Running Persistence Benchmarks:**
```bash
./gradlew :benchmarks:jmh -Pjmh.includes="*Persistence*"
```

---

### Monitoring & Profiling

**Key Metrics to Track:**

1. **Processing Rate**
   ```java
   long rate = actor.getProcessingRate();
   ```

2. **Mailbox Depth**
   ```java
   int depth = actor.getCurrentSize();
   ```

3. **Message Latency**
   - Measure: Timestamp in message
   - Target: Meet SLA requirements

4. **Backpressure Status**
   ```java
   boolean active = actor.isBackpressureActive();
   ```
